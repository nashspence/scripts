## Development workflow
1. Format & lint all changes:
   ```
   pre-commit run --files <files>
   ```
2. Run dependency-free unit tests:
   ```
   pytest
   ```
3. Do **not** run integration tests locally. GitHub Actions executes:
   ```
   pytest -m integration
   ```
4. GitHub Actions CI runs `pre-commit run --all-files`, `pytest`, and `pytest -m integration` on all supported platforms.
5. For portable services with a `Containerfile`, update `spec.md`. Directories containing only a `release.yaml` do not require a spec.

Scripts are containerised for crossâ€‘platform use with Podman. Host-specific helpers (e.g. in `osx/`) are only for tasks that do not containerise cleanly.

When writing shell scripts, prefer POSIX-compliant `sh` and use other shells only when absolutely necessary.
Each Podman script directory must include a `spec.md` written using modern Gauge conventions (`Scenario:` headings and `Given`/`When`/`Then` steps with parameter placeholders). Break steps into single, atomic actions and expectations to keep scenarios easily testable. For CLI specs, pass each flag or argument in its own step before the final run step. Specs should contain the minimal scenarios necessary for complete coverage of the script's features, including every command-line flag and argument. Use a single spec per platform-specific directory (e.g. `osx/spec.md`). If needed, keep script-specific terminology in a `glossary.md` alongside the spec.

## Unit tests
- Place tests in a `tests/` directory adjacent to the code.
- Mock external commands and filesystem interactions; unit tests should exercise only the code under test.
